PROBLEM ANALYSIS: Feature 18529 Explanation Issue
================================================================================

CURRENT EXPLANATION: "Smart Beta Equity ETPs globally increased"

⚠️  PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: This explanation is based on ONLY 2 examples out of 25!

================================================================================
THE EVIDENCE
================================================================================

1. EXPLANATION APPEARS IN ONLY 2 EXAMPLES:
   - Example 3 (max_activation=9.75): Contains "Equity" (but activation=0.64, very low)
   - Example 10 (max_activation=7.125): Contains "Smart Beta Equity ETPs globally increased"
     * This is the 10th strongest example (not even in top 5!)
     * Activation of 7.125 is much lower than top examples (11.0, 10.125, 9.75)

2. TOP EXAMPLES (by activation) ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT:
   
   Example 1 (max_act=11.0) - HIGHEST:
   "To Extend Auto And Home Insurance Program For AARP Members"
   - About insurance programs, not Smart Beta ETPs
   
   Example 2 (max_act=10.125) - SECOND HIGHEST:
   "Company News For Jul 1 1, 2 0 1 9"
   - About company news dates, not Smart Beta ETPs
   
   Example 3 (max_act=9.75) - THIRD HIGHEST:
   "Equity CEFs: 1 0 % Yields With Some Defense For Your Portfolio"
   - About Equity CEFs (Closed-End Funds), not Smart Beta ETPs
   - Contains "Equity" but in a different context
   
   Example 4 (max_act=8.375) - FOURTH HIGHEST:
   "SPDR ETF Report For Monday, April 1 3"
   - About ETF reports, not Smart Beta ETPs
   
   Example 5 (max_act=8.0625) - FIFTH HIGHEST:
   "Analyst Blog"
   - About analyst blogs, not Smart Beta ETPs

3. MOST COMMON PATTERNS ACROSS ALL EXAMPLES:
   - "<SPECIAL_12>" appears in 50 examples (section separators)
   - "E" appears in 10 examples (likely part of "ETF", "ETP", etc.)
   - "Anal" + "Blog" appears in 6 examples (Analyst Blog sections)
   - "Results" appears in 5 examples
   - "ETF" or "ETP" related terms appear in several examples
   - Financial news headers and dates appear frequently

================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED
================================================================================

The explainer LLM likely:
1. Saw Example 10 with the phrase "Smart Beta Equity ETPs globally increased"
2. This phrase is very specific and memorable
3. The LLM focused on this ONE specific phrase rather than finding common patterns
4. It ignored the fact that this appears in only 1-2 examples out of 25

This is a FAILURE of the explanation process because:
- The explanation should represent MOST examples, not just 1-2
- The explanation is based on a lower-activation example (7.125) when there are
  examples with much higher activations (11.0, 10.125, 9.75)
- The explanation doesn't capture the common patterns across examples

================================================================================
WHAT THE EXPLANATION SHOULD BE
================================================================================

Based on the actual patterns:

COMMON PATTERNS:
1. Financial news headers and section markers ("<SPECIAL_12>")
2. ETF/ETP related content (appears in multiple examples)
3. Analyst Blog sections (appears in 6 examples)
4. Company news and reports
5. Financial product announcements

A BETTER EXPLANATION MIGHT BE:
- "ETF and financial product reports in analyst blog sections"
- "Financial news headers and ETF-related announcements"
- "ETF reports and financial product news sections"

These would better represent the feature because they:
- Appear in multiple examples (not just 1-2)
- Capture common patterns across examples
- Represent what the feature actually fires on most often

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

1. The explanation "Smart Beta Equity ETPs globally increased" is TOO SPECIFIC
   and based on a rare example.

2. The explainer LLM should be improved to:
   - Require explanations to match at least 5-10 examples
   - Weight examples by activation strength
   - Find common patterns, not rare specific phrases
   - Validate that explanations represent the majority of examples

3. For this feature, the explanation should be regenerated with:
   - Focus on common patterns across top examples
   - Weight by activation strength
   - Require minimum example coverage

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The current explanation is WRONG because:
✓ It's based on only 1-2 examples out of 25
✓ It's based on a lower-activation example (7.125) when top examples are 11.0+
✓ It doesn't represent the common patterns across examples
✓ It's overly specific to one rare phrase

The feature likely captures:
- Financial news section headers
- ETF/ETP related content
- Analyst blog sections
- Financial product announcements

NOT specifically "Smart Beta Equity ETPs globally increased" which appears
in only one example.
