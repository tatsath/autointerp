# AutoInterp - SAE Interpretability System

Two complementary approaches for understanding what features in your SAE model have learned.

## 🎯 What This Does

Three complementary approaches for understanding what features in your SAE model have learned.

**Step 1:** Use AutoInterp Lite to quickly find relevant features and get basic labels. **Step 2:** Use AutoInterp Lite Plus for comprehensive analysis with advanced metrics. **Step 3:** Use AutoInterp Full with the exact feature numbers from Step 1 to get detailed explanations with confidence scores.

### 1. AutoInterp Lite - Feature Discovery
**Find relevant features in minutes, not hours**

- **Why needed**: SAE models have thousands of features. You need to find the 10-50 that matter for your domain (finance, healthcare, legal, etc.).
- **What it does**: Compares feature activations on domain-specific vs general text
- **Key metrics**: Activation strength, specialization score, top activating examples
- **Speed**: 2-5 minutes for 1000+ features
- **Output**: Ranked list of domain-relevant features with activation examples

### 2. AutoInterp Lite Plus - Comprehensive Analysis
**Advanced metrics with clustering and polysemanticity analysis**

- **Why needed**: Get deeper insights into feature quality with comprehensive metrics including clustering, polysemanticity, F1 scores, and robustness testing
- **What it does**: Enhanced version of AutoInterp Lite with advanced clustering analysis, classification metrics, and quality assessment
- **Key metrics**: F1 score, precision, recall, selectivity, clustering, polysemanticity, robustness
- **Speed**: 5-10 minutes for comprehensive analysis
- **Output**: Detailed quality assessment table with feature rankings and recommendations

### 3. AutoInterp Full - Feature Explanation  
**Understand what your features actually do**

- **Why needed**: Knowing a feature is "financial" isn't enough - you need to know if it detects "earnings reports" vs "market volatility"
- **What it does**: Uses LLMs to generate human-readable explanations with confidence scores
- **Key metrics**: F1 score, precision, recall, explanation quality
- **Speed**: 30-60 minutes per feature (due to LLM analysis)
- **Output**: Detailed explanations with confidence scores and validation

### Run Examples
```bash
# Run with API (recommended)
cd autointerp_full
./example_LLM_API.sh

# Run offline
./example_LLM_offline.sh
```

## 🧠 AutoInterp Full - Advanced Feature Analysis

AutoInterp Full provides comprehensive feature interpretability using LLM-based analysis with contrastive learning and confidence scoring. It generates human-readable explanations with F1 scores, precision, and recall metrics to validate feature quality.

### 🔍 Contrastive Search & FAISS Integration

**Purpose of Contrastive Search:**
AutoInterp Full uses FAISS-based contrastive learning to improve explanation quality by finding semantically similar but non-activating examples. This helps the LLM distinguish between truly relevant features and false positives, leading to more accurate and robust explanations.

**How It Works:**
1. **Embedding Generation**: Uses sentence-transformers to create text embeddings
2. **FAISS Index**: Builds similarity search index of non-activating examples  
3. **Contrastive Prompting**: Shows both activating and non-activating examples to the LLM
4. **Better Explanations**: AI can distinguish between similar-looking content for semantic understanding

### 💬 Chat Model Requirements

AutoInterp Full requires **chat-formatted models only** for proper explanation generation. Supported models include:

| Model Type | Examples | Provider |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **HuggingFace Chat** | `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` | Offline |
| **OpenAI Chat** | `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4` | OpenRouter/OpenAI |
| **Other Chat Models** | `google/gemma-2b-it`, `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` | Various |

**Important**: Base models (like `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`) are used for SAE analysis, while chat models are used for explanation generation.

### 🎯 Running AutoInterp Full & Viewing Results
