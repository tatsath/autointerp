## Abstract

Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of artificial intelligence (AI) models, which is especially important in financial applications where decisions often carry significant economic consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this comprehensive study, we apply AutoInterp Lite and AutoInterp Full to the Llama-2-7B model trained on financial texts to interpret its internal representations across multiple layers. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of financially relevant concepts including earnings reports, interest rate announcements, performance metrics, stock indicators, economic indicators, and emerging financial technologies. We further examine the influence of these features across multiple layers (4, 10, 16, 22, 28) of the model, demonstrating layer-specific specialization patterns and hierarchical concept learning. Our results reveal practical insights into the internal concepts learned by financial language models, marking a significant step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of finance-adapted large language models, and paving the way for improved model transparency in financial applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Recent advancements in financial language models and automated financial analysis have revolutionized how AI systems assist in financial decision-making, risk assessment, market analysis, and regulatory compliance. However, despite strong performance on financial benchmarks, our understanding of which financial concepts these models have learned—and how they use them in the analysis process—remains fundamentally limited. This lack of interpretability poses critical challenges in high-stakes domains like finance, where trust, transparency, and safety are paramount for regulatory compliance and user adoption.

The financial services industry faces increasing pressure to adopt AI systems while maintaining explainability and accountability. Regulatory frameworks such as the EU's AI Act and the US Federal Reserve's guidance on AI in financial services emphasize the need for interpretable AI systems. Traditional black-box approaches, while effective, fail to meet these regulatory requirements and user trust expectations.

### 1.2 Mechanistic Interpretability in Financial AI

Mechanistic interpretability aims to address these challenges by reverse-engineering the internal computations of neural networks, providing insights into how models process and represent information. In this context, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising tool for inspecting model representations, especially for large language models.

SAEs work by mapping dense model activation vectors to a larger, sparse latent space, potentially disentangling human-interpretable 'monosemantic' features. These features can then be labeled at scale using LLMs through a process known as automated interpretability. This approach has enabled insights into model behavior across various domains, including language processing, computer vision, and protein analysis.

### 1.3 Financial Domain Specificity

Financial language models face unique challenges that make interpretability particularly crucial:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial institutions must explain AI decisions to regulators
2. **Risk Management**: Understanding model behavior is essential for risk assessment
3. **Market Impact**: AI decisions can influence market behavior and require transparency
4. **User Trust**: Financial professionals need to understand and trust AI recommendations
5. **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating biases in financial AI systems

### 1.4 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. Apply SAE-based interpretability to financial language models
2. Identify and characterize financially relevant features across multiple model layers
3. Analyze layer-specific specialization patterns in financial concept learning
4. Develop automated workflows for financial feature discovery and analysis
5. Provide insights for practical applications in financial AI systems

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 SAE-Based Interpretability on Language Models

The foundation of SAE-based interpretability was established by Templeton et al. (2024) and Gao et al. (2024), who performed automated interpretability studies on large proprietary models. Cunningham et al. (2024) quantitatively benchmarked the automatic interpretability success of SAEs against classic unsupervised methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of SAE-based approaches.

Large-scale interpretability efforts by Lieberum et al. (2024) and He et al. (2024) have focused on public models, training suites of SAEs across all layers with various hyperparameters and publishing their weights and corresponding auto-interpretations. This work has enabled researchers to build upon often-expensive analyses and has established best practices for SAE-based interpretability.

### 2.2 SAEs in Specialized Domains

Recent work has extended SAE-based interpretability to specialized domains:

**Healthcare Applications**: Le et al. (2024) fitted an SAE to a pathology image foundation model and qualitatively validated several interpretable histological concepts. The radiology-focused work by Bouzid et al. (2025) applied Matryoshka-SAE to MAIRA-2, identifying clinically relevant concepts including medical devices, pathologies, and temporal changes.

**Multimodal Applications**: Zhang et al. (2024) used SAEs to analyze visual features in general-domain multimodal models, employing larger multimodal models to automatically explain learned features. Lou et al. (2025) investigated SAE features for guiding data selection to improve modality alignment.

### 2.3 Financial AI and Interpretability

While extensive work exists on financial AI applications, limited research has focused on interpretability:

**Financial Language Models**: Recent work has developed specialized financial language models, but interpretability analysis remains limited.

**Risk Assessment**: Traditional financial risk models rely on interpretable features, but modern AI approaches often sacrifice interpretability for performance.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Growing regulatory requirements for AI explainability in finance have increased interest in interpretable AI systems.

### 2.4 Automated Interpretability Methods

The field of automated interpretability has evolved significantly:

**LLM-Based Labeling**: Using large language models to automatically generate human-readable labels for discovered features.

**Confidence Scoring**: Developing metrics to assess the reliability and consistency of feature interpretations.

**Contrastive Analysis**: Comparing feature activations across different domains to identify specialized concepts.

## 9. Acknowledgments

This research builds upon the AutoInterp framework and leverages open-source models including Llama-2-7B and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Special thanks to the open-source community for making these tools and models available.

We acknowledge the contributions of the broader mechanistic interpretability community, particularly the work on SAE-based interpretability that made this research possible. The financial AI community's focus on interpretability and transparency has been instrumental in motivating this work.
